# Overview

Parca is a continuous profiling project. Continuous profiling is the act of taking profiles (such as CPU, Memory, I/O and more) of programs in a systematic way. Parca collects, stores and makes profiles available to be queried over time. It features a powerful multi-dimensional data model, storage and query engine specifically designed for profiling data.

The Parca project houses two main components:

* Parca: The server that stores profiling data and allows it to be queried ana analyzed over time.
* Parca Agent: An eBPF based profiler, that can automatically discover targets to profile such as Kubernetes containers or SystemD units.
