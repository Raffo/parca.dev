# Overview

Parca is a continuous profiling project. Continuous profiling is the act of taking profiles (such as CPU, Memory, I/O and more) of programs in a systematic way. Parca collects, stores and makes profiles available to be queried over time. It features a powerful multi-dimensional data model, storage and query engine specifically designed for profiling data.

The Parca project houses two main components:

* Parca: The server that stores profiling data and allows it to be queried ana analyzed over time.
* Parca Agent: An eBPF based profiler, that can automatically discover targets to profile such as Kubernetes containers or SystemD units.

## Getting Started

## What does the name mean?

It plays on the Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA) and the practice of ice core _**profiling**_ that has been done as part of it to study climate change. Hopefully with this open source project we can reduce some carbon emissions produced by unnecessary resource usage of data centers.
